# Developer Setup

## Running the Application

1. **Server**: Open a terminal and run:
   ```
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the server on port 3000.

2. **Client**: Open a second terminal and run:
   ```
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the client development server.

Please keep both terminals open while developing. The terminals will show real-time logs of the application which are helpful for debugging.
